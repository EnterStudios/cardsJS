# cardsJS
Showing playing cards that are scalable in a browser.

I'm using the [Vectorized Playing Cards 1.3](http://code.google.com/p/vectorized-playing-cards/) designed by Chris Aguilar, see the [readme file](images/readme.txt) for the details. The original SVGs are changed to *not* render in an A4 page, but to fit to size.

## Cards

Use an `<img cid='id'>` HTML tag; where *id* is the identifier of the card.  The id is composed of the rank and then thesuit of the card,
e.g. 'KS' is the [King of spades](https://rawgit.com/richardschneider/cardsJS/master/images/KS.svg). 
The suits are 'S', 'H', 'D' and 'C' for spades, hearts, diamonds and clubs. The rank '10' of a suit is either '10*x*' or 'T*x*'.

    The king of spades is rendered as <img cid='KS'/>.
    
## Hands

Cards can be grouped into a hand.  A hand is an `<ol class='hand'>` followed by list items with the `card` tag. When the mouse is over a `card` in an hand, the card is moved veritically/horizontally to indicate that it will be selected.

    <ol class="hand hhand-compact">
		<li><img cid="AS"></li>
		<li><img cid="KS"></li>
		<li><img cid="QS"></li>
		<li><img cid="JS"></li>
		<li><img cid="10S"></li>
		<li><img cid="9H"></li>
		<li><img cid="3H"></li>
	</ol>
